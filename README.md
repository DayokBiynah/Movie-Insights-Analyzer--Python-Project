- Detect and visualize correlations between numerical features.
- Analyze relationships such as:
  - Budget vs. Gross Earnings
  - Score vs. Gross Earnings
  - Company-wise gross earnings
- Factorize categorical data to make it analyzable with correlation metrics.
- Build correlation matrices for both numerical and categorical data.
- Visualize data using seaborn and matplotlib.
